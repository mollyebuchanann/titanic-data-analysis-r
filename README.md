# Titanic Data Analysis in R using Tidyverse

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using the `tidyverse` collection of R packages. The goal is to uncover patterns in survival rates based on features such as sex, age, class, and fare, and to visualize those insights using `ggplot2`.
